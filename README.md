## Understand Germany

### Tipping

I usually aim to tip around 10% if I've received good service. This is only for table-service - for anything else I tend to tip nothing. The tipping culture might be a cause for ...

### Bad Service

If you're coming from a place that puts a lot of emphasis on service culture, be prepared for the worst in Berlin and Germany in general. Be happy if your food and drink is good and take everything else as a nice bonus. :)

### Water in restaurants

It might be shocking for you that free of charge table water in restaurants is extremely uncommon here. In my experience, if you ask explicetly for a glass of "Leitungswasser" then you will get it, but it is so uncommon here that your waiter might react confused.

### Tap water

Tap water is save to drink in the entire country and everyone I know drinks it daily.

## Understand Berlin

- Former division: You will have a much richer experience if you try to understand how the mechanics of the German division (1949-1990) worked. You can see countless things everywhere you look that can be explained by Berlin having been two (very different cities) not so long ago. While moving around in the city, try to understand if you're positioned in former East- or West-Berlin.

## Transportation

Use one of the many apps that offer you access to e-scooter, e-mopeds, cars or bikes for ad-hoc rentals - or use public transport for which you will need ...

### Tickets

For local transport, I recommend either a 24h ticket for something between 9-12€ (only valid in Berlin) or a Deutschlandticket which costs only 49€ and is valid for an entire calendar month. The latter is valid in all public transportation up to regional trains (ex-cluding long distance and bullet trains) in the entire country. So in theory, if you have time, you can explore all of Germany for a month for 49€. But it will already be worth it for a week of exploring Berlin. The only downside is that you have to start a subscription (using one of many apps that will re-sell it) and immediately cancel it again to not be billed for a second month.

### Getting around Berlin

Berlin doesn't have a classic city center and getting from one sub-center to another might take you as much as 45mins. So plan accordingly and bundle the things you want to do/see and a specific part of the city.

## Stay safe

I have lived here full-time now for 11 years and never had any issues. Even most single women I know take public transort late at night. You might have an occasional (harmless) crazy person on your train but that matches my experience in pretty much every other major metropolis I've visited. There has been an increase in homelessness in the more recent years.
